# Lift Your Weight

A web app that allows you track your weight lifting progress for the exercises you choose.

## A project created to help me learn react

### Phase 1: Create base of web app based on initial learning

- Create this project based on what I learn about React from the tutorial listed below and the documentation
- Not making use of any permanent storage or react hooks thus far
- Resources: [React & Redux Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxIDLw0M-m0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ij8CfkAY2RAGb-tmkNwQHG) course by The Net Ninja, React Documentation, Redux Documentation, Stack Overflow

### Phase 2: Refactor project to use react hooks and context where applicable

- Refactor project based on what I learn about react hooks
- Use local storage for storing exercise, workouts, and history

### Phase 3: Implement service worker

- Implement service worker so that app is some what functional offline

### Phase 4: Implement permanent data

- At this stage I have not decided what I want to use for the backend

### Phase 5: Authentication and Authorization

### Phase 6: Convert to server side rendered application?

### Phase 7: Iterate
